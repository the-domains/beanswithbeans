Welcome to Beans with beans!  This is a website dedicated to my and Cate's first daughter, Amelia.  She got the nickname Beans because Cate ate a lot of bean and cheese burritos when she was pregnant.  After Amelia picked up a bag of unroasted green coffee beans, I was inspired to take photos of her with all sorts of other kinds of beans.
